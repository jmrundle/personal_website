    This website is a personal project of mine, meant to introduce me to technologies like AWS, Nginx, and Flask, while also
    providing an outlet to express myself.
  - >
    A more notable feature of this site is the Spotify and Github API integration, found on the "More"
    page, which specifies some of my recent personal listening habits and git activity.
